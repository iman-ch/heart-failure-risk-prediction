# heart-failure-risk-prediction

## Dataset
This project uses the [Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data/data), from Kaggle. It reports 299 patients' data, including 13 clinical features, along with a response variable `DEATH_EVENT` to signify a patient's death during a follow-up period (1= death, 0=survival).

## Goal
To apply statistical learning methods to predict a patient's death rate due to heart failure based on clinical features, and thus identify key predictors and principal components associated with survival outcomes.
